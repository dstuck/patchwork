Q: Let's work to create a deck. We want a deck object and the hand is drawn from tiles in the deck
A: Created Deck.cs to manage tile collection, with TileHand drawing from it. Added draw pile, discard pile, and shuffle mechanics. Modified TileHand to reference deck and draw initial hand. See Deck.cs lines 1-94 and TileHand.cs lines 14-47.

Q: What resources do I need to modify to update this code?
A: Need to: 1. Create new Deck.cs script 2. Modify TileHand.cs to include deck reference and hand size 3. Update TileHand's RemoveCurrentTile method 4. Fix TileHand's Start method syntax error 5. Create TileData asset in Unity Editor for initial deck.

Q: NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
A: Error occurs because Deck component isn't created yet. Created Deck.cs with initialization, shuffle, draw and discard methods. Updated TileHand.cs Start method to properly check for null deck reference and handle initial hand drawing. See Deck.cs lines 1-94 and TileHand.cs lines 23-47.

Q: It'd be nice to have a visual of the deck itself. Maybe on click it would pop up a display of all the tiles in it?
A: Created DeckUI component to show popup with all tiles. Added GetAllTiles method to Deck. Created UI hierarchy with button and popup panel. See DeckUI.cs lines 1-85 and added GetAllTiles method to Deck.cs lines 84-92.

Q: Should the button be in the same canvas as the hand panel or do I create a new one first?
A: Keep deck button in same canvas as hand panel for consistency in UI scaling and organization. Create button as sibling to TileHand panel, using same canvas hierarchy. Add popup panel in same canvas with grid layout for tile previews.

Q: How do I create the button to close the popup?
A: Added close button to DeckUI. Modified DeckUI script to handle close button click. Created UI button in top-right corner of popup panel with "X" text. See DeckUI.cs lines 10-34 for implementation details.
