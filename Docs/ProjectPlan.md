# Game Project Plan

## Project Overview
Patchwork will be a 2D deckbuilding game where the player will curate a deck of tile cards of different shapes and abilities that they will need to use to try to patch up different shaped holes on a board. They will need to beat consecutive rounds of board with different challenges that will lead to upgrades to their deck.

## Milestones

## Notes
- Obviously the player's tiles will be upgraded as they progress, but maybe the board itself can be upgraded as well. That could be a path for larger scale "boss" upgrades perhaps.
