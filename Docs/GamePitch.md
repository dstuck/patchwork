PatchWork is a game about trying to do your job as a contract worker while the CEO lights jet fuel hoping it will take you to outer space.

Your job is to patch over bad wiring and collect bonuses by placing tiles carefully and quickly on the board. As the game progresses your boss will introduce more and more dangers while trying to reach exponential growth and it's your job to put out all the fires and make sure the entire company doesn't explode.
